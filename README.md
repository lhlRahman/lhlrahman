👋 Hey Welcome to my Github!

🔍 I am currently looking for Summer 2024 Opportunities or research positions.

🌆 I am located in Toronto, Ontario, and I have a passion for Full Stack Development.

🔗 Check out some of my work at https://www.habibrahman.xyz.

💻 Some of the technologies I work with are React, Next.js, Express, JavaScript/HTML/CSS, TypeScript, Java, Python, TailwindCSS, and C# (.NET Core).

🏋️‍♂️ In my free time, I like to lift weights and build side projects.
